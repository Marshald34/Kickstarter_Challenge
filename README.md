# Kickstarter_Challenge
Module 1 Challenge for Data Analytics Bootcamp

The purpose of this analysis is to help Louise decide the best times to set up a fundraising campaign via Kickstarter so that she can have the most successful fundraiser possible. 

  Analysis and Challenges:
    












Conclusion:
  The best time to run a Kickstarter campaign for a play would be May. June was close to May for successful campaigns. So to maximize effectiveness, run the crowdfunding campaing from May - June. The worst time it seems to run a crowdfunding campaign appears to be October. The most failed campaigns happened during October.
  
  The most successful funding campaigns weren't requesting a lot of money. The sweetspot for asking for funds is Under $5,000. Campaigns that asked for $5,000 had a much higher chance of being successful (over 70% success rate).
   
   I would say some of the limitations of this dataset is that there isn't that much data. There are 8 years of data for plays in the dataset but there are only roughly a thousand campaigns ran for funding in that time span. 125 campaigns per year is a small dataset to me. If the data could go back further it might be easier to spot trends in the data.
   
   Another graph that we could create would be a pie graph of the successful Theater category. It would be beneficial to see what other theater categories had a successful kickstarter. To go along with the chart we could do a pivot table of all of the theater entries that would show the most successful category. After doing that chart, however, plays was the most successful Theater category.
