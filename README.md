# Kickstarter_Challenge
Module 1 Challenge for Data Analytics Bootcamp

The purpose of this analysis is to help Louise decide the best times to set up a fundraising campaign via Kickstarter so that she can have the most successful fundraiser possible. 
Analysis and Challenges:

  To start this analysis I did a pivot table of all the data and filtered to show theater kickstarter campaigns. After I had the table filtered by theater, I went more in depth and analyzed the successful campaigns based on when they were run. Below is a graph that was created to show when the most successful campaigns were run for theaters. From this graph I concluded that the most successful time to run a campaign was from May to June.

  After the successful campaigns by launch date, we looked more into the Plays subcategory which Louise was really passionate about and looking into. For this, I split out the data in to Successful, Failed, and Cancelled and dropped them into buckets of goal ranges to determine what was the most ideal amount for a goal to reach that would yield the most successful outcome. From that, I concluded that setting a goal of under $5,000 would be the most beneficial since over 70% of campaigns that asked for less than $5,000 had the most success.

Conclusion:

   The best time to run a Kickstarter campaign for a play would be May. June was close to May for successful campaigns. So to maximize effectiveness, run the crowdfunding campaing from May - June. The worst time it seems to run a crowdfunding campaign appears to be October. The most failed campaigns happened during October.
  
   The most successful funding campaigns weren't requesting a lot of money. The sweetspot for asking for funds is Under $5,000. Campaigns that asked for $5,000 had a much higher chance of being successful (over 70% success rate).
   
   I would say some of the limitations of this dataset is that there isn't that much data. There are 8 years of data for plays in the dataset but there are only roughly a thousand campaigns ran for funding in that time span. 125 campaigns per year is a small dataset to me. If the data could go back further it might be easier to spot trends in the data.
   
   Another graph that we could create would be a pie graph of the successful Theater category. It would be beneficial to see what other theater categories had a successful kickstarter. To go along with the chart we could do a pivot table of all of the theater entries that would show the most successful category. After doing that chart, however, plays was the most successful Theater category.
